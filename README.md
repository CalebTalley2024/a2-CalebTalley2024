## Your Web Application Title
My website is a todo list website application, It gives you the options to save lists of your tasks ( with fields for difficulty, type of task, school semester, Year, and the difficulty  that your semester will be (DerivedSemester) ). This app also gives you the option to remove tasks that you either completed, or dont want any more

## Technical Achievements
**Technical Achievement 1**
-  This Todo list website is a single-page app. It provides a form for users to submit data on the top, and shows the current state of the server-side data on the bottom after the 'submit' button is pressed.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
**Design Achievement 1**: 
- I tested this website with 2 of my friends.

Friend 1: Ma
	-  What problems did the user have with your design?
		- The app tasks looks complicated (because of the JSON
		- Everything looks clumped up, making the site look visually unpleasant
	-   What comments did they make that surprised you?
		-   saying that everything looked clumped up surprised me. I realized that when I  was designing the app, I thought about it being used on a more vertical display, as opposed to a more horizontal display.
	-  What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
		- proportions of text, borders and shapes
		- remove JSON syntax text from Tasks section
- Friend 2: Talley
	- What problems did the user have with your design?
		- used "type task here" instead of "sample text" in the task place holder.
		- add more spacing to the "Task to Complete" table header (  "Task To-do Type Difficulty Year Derived Semester" )
		- Task output makes the app look unpleasant.
	- What comments did they make that surprised you?
		- Being told to use "type task here" instead of "sample text"  surprised me the most. That makes more sense in hindsight, but I would not have been thinking about that.
	- What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
		- remove JSON syntax text from Tasks section
		- add placeholders to all 'new Task' fields
